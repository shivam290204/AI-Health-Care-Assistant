## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and a code editor (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/shivam290204/Ai-Health-Care-Assistant.git](https://github.com/shivam290204/Ai-Health-Care-Assistant.git)
    ```
2.  **Get a Google Gemini API Key**
    * Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * Click "**Create API key**" and copy the generated key.
3.  **Add the API Key to the project**
    * Open the `index.html` file.
    * Find the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the file.
    * Locate the following line:
        ```javascript
        const apiKey = ""; // Handled by environment
        ```
    * Paste your API key inside the quotation marks:
        ```javascript
        const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
        ```
4.  **Run the application with a local server**
    * You cannot run this project by opening the HTML file directly in the browser due to CORS policy restrictions on API requests.
    * **If you are using VS Code**, the easiest way is to install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
    * After installation, right-click the `index.html` file and select "**Open with Live Server**". This will open the project in your browser on a local server.

## Usage

Once the application is running in your browser:

1.  Use the **Health Chat** tab for general questions.
2.  Switch to the **Analyze Medical Report** tab to paste and simplify report text.
3.  Navigate to the **Lifestyle Advisor** tab to get a symptom action plan or generate a meal plan.
